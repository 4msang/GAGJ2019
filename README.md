# KITCHEN HERO
> A wicked problem is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 The topic
Our team [Roze Koeken](https://www.facebook.com/rozekoekenGGJ2019/) is presenting an approach to solve one of the wicked problems in the world, under the given topic of the Game Jam, "Food for Possible Futures". We focused on drawing attention to the problem of food waste.

### 1.2 Rationale
PSAs are important because they alarm the audience of the seriousness of problems. But not every alarms ring right next to your ears. PSAs can be educational, and games can also be educational. We decided to create a cooking game that instructs player a recipe and virtually introduce an opportunity to cook, store leftover ingredients, and dispose food wastes.

### 1.3 Ideas
> 1. Cooking recipes should be shown spontaneously.
> 2. The game should be interactive but different from an old-school cooking games.
>     1. Controllers should be supported to make the game physically interactive.
>     2. Ingredients should be automatically moved by a conveyor belt.
>     3. The genre of the game in general should be rhythm action.
> 3. Ways to dispose different food wastes should be informed.
>     1. Food wastes should be produced by every user action.
>         1. Chop an onion by swinging a controller horizontally -> onion peel
>     2. This step should be shown as another minigame after the cooking phase.

### 1.4 Note
We later admitted that our game idea was created under a great influence of [**Rhythm Heaven**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Heaven).
